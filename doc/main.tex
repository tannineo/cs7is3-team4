  Information retrieval is an important concept in todayâ€™s information world. An efficient search engine helps users to obtain the relevant information even if the query is not properly framed. Lucene is one such library in Java used to index and search the dataset provided as input to it. It has an in-built analyzers object used to index the words and rank it accordingly. Data from four different sources including Financial Times Limited, Federal Register, Foreign Broadcast Information Service, Los Angeles Times were the input corpora for the query to be processed. A separate topic file is selected as a query file and the result of 1000 hits per topic is considered for evaluation. Custom analyzers based on synonyms are built to analyze the indexed data and to query.

\section{Introduction}
Information Retrieval is the process of finding the relevant information in a document and presenting the result when a query is made.
Lucene\cite{lucene} is a library built in java made specifically to implement search engines and provide relevant information to users.
Data considered for the process of finding the relevance is the collection of different articles from four different news publishers including Financial times limited, Federal Register, Foreign Broadcast Information Service and Los Angeles Times.
There are articles from various domains including medicine, philosophy, economics, tourism etc and each of the publisher has more than 10 documents containing articles in each of them.
The articles are published and maintained by National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) to make it available for the research community to work on improving the techniques for handling the information retrieval process.
The data in the corpora is in the form of Standard Generalized Markup Language(SGML) and this is parsed using Jsoup\cite{jsoup}, a library used to parse HTML and URL.Each field in the article is parsed in separate index and the same is stored for analyzing with the provided query.
A query file is provided and the same is parsed to obtain the separate fields from it which is then queried along the indexed data corpora.A custom analyzer is built which is used to analyze the indexed documents with respect to the provided query.
The analyzer is built in which custom stop words were made to be removed from the document while querying the same.This list of stop words is chosen based on the trial performed on the process of evaluating with Trec\_Eval\cite{trec_eval}, and the top list is selected which provides the maximum relevancy result.
Trec\_Eval is maintained by National Institute of Standards and Technology which release the evaluation files  which is considered as gold standard for comparing the performance of the obtained result.
Moving average precision score is calculated and the goal is to improve the score so that the performance of the search engine is also optimised.
