\section{Summary}

In this work we did a comparison on the existing analyzers and scorers provided by Lucene. A group of cuntomized analyzers are implemented with refined word lists, like longer stopwords list and special terms and words like countries. We also make use of synonym query expanding and graph query. We find that the hyperparameters (boosts) of the query parser affect the result critically, and we believe other hyperparameters for the analyzers are also important. A broader research should be made on the processing and a better way is needed for cross validation.
