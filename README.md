# cs7is3-team4

The group assignment of Team 4 for CS7IS3

## How to

Download the renamed corpora from [issues/2#issuecomment-600780315](https://github.com/tannineo/cs7is3-team4/issues/2#issuecomment-600780315). Extract the corpora as the `corpora` folder.

Build the project using the script `compile.sh`.

```text
$ sh compile.sh
```

A jar called `InfoSeekers.jar` should appear at the root of the project folder.

Run the compiled `InfoSeekers.jar` file.

```text
$ java -jar InfoSeekers.jar
```
